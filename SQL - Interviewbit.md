## Euclid's Distance
**medium**


Given a table HOUSES, find the euclidean distance between points with the largest X and Y coordinate, and the points with the smallest X and Y coordinate.

The Euclidean Distance between 2 points P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2) is defined as: sqrt((x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

```sql
SELECT sqrt(POW(MAX(XCoordinate)-MIN(XCoordinate),2)+POW(MAX(YCoordinate)-MIN(YCoordinate),2)) as "A" from HOUSES
```
