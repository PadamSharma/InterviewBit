## Total Moves For Bishop!
**very easy**

Asked In:
Goldman Sachs

Problem Description

Given the position of a Bishop (A, B) on an 8 * 8 chessboard.

Your task is to count the total number of squares that can be visited by the Bishop in one move.

The position of the Bishop is denoted using row and column number of the chessboard.

```c++
int Solution::solve(int A, int B) {
    int ans;
    int x=A,y=B;
    // ++
    while(++x<=8 && ++y<=8){
        ans++;
    }
    // --
    x=A,y=B;
    while(--x>=1 && --y>=1){
        ans++;
    }
    // +-
    x=A,y=B;
    while(++x<=8 && --y>=1){
        ans++;
    }
    // -+
    x=A,y=B;
    while(--x>=1 && ++y<=8){
        ans++;
    }

## Distribute in Circle!
**easy**

Asked In:
Goldman Sachs

Problem Description

A items are to be delivered in a circle of size B.

Find the position where the Ath item will be delivered if we start from a given position C.

NOTE: Items are distributed at adjacent positions starting from C.

> We can add C-1 to the number of items as it would not change the configuration anyhow.

> A%B gives the number of items left to distribute, and A%B+C-1 = TOTAL number of items left to distribute.

> If C would be large enough then mod B would give the position of the last item on that circle.

```c++
int Solution::solve(int A, int B, int C) {
    return (A%B +C-1)%B;
}

## FizzBuzz
**very easy**

    Fizzbuzz is one of the most basic problems in the coding interview world. Try to write a small and elegant code for this problem.

Given a positive integer A, return an array of strings with all the integers from 1 to N. 

But for multiples of 3 the array should have “Fizz” instead of the number. 

For the multiples of 5, the array should have “Buzz” instead of the number. 

For numbers which are multiple of 3 and 5 both, the array should have “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.

```c++
vector<string> Solution::fizzBuzz(int A) {
    vector<string> ans;
    for(int i = 1;i<=A;i++){
        string p="";
        if(i%3!=0 && i%5!=0){
            p+=to_string(i);
        }
        if(i%3==0){
            p+="Fizz";
        }
        if(i%5==0){
            p+="Buzz";
        }
        ans.push_back(p);
    }
    return ans;
}

Problem Description

Given four positive integers A, B, C, D, determine if there’s a rectangle such that the lengths of its sides are A, B, C and D (in any order).

If any such rectangle exist return 1 else return 0.

```c++
int Solution::solve(int A, int B, int C, int D) {
    return (A==B && C==D) || (A==C && B==D);

Given an even number ( greater than 2 ), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to given number.

NOTE A solution will always exist. read Goldbach’s  conjecture

```c++
vector<int> Solution::primesum(int A) {
    vector<bool> prime(A + 1, true);
 
    for (int p = 2; p * p <= A; p++) {
        // If prime[p] is not changed, then it is a prime
        if (prime[p] == true) {
            // Update all multiples of p greater than or
            // equal to the square of it numbers which are
            // multiple of p and are less than p^2 are
            // already been marked.
            for (int i = p * p; i <= A; i += p)
                prime[i] = false;
        }

Given a positive integer which fits in a 32 bit signed integer, find if it can be expressed as A^P where P > 1 and A > 0. A and P both should be integers.

```c++

Problem Description
 
 

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

A palindrome integer is an integer x for which reverse(x) = x where reverse(x) is x with its digit reversed. Negative numbers are not palindromic.
