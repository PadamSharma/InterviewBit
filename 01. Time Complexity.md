# Analysis of Algorithms
## Θ Notation : Tight Bound or maybe Loose Bound

`
Θ(g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c1, c2 and n0
`

`
such that, 0 <= c1*g(n) <= f(n) <= c2*g(n) for all n >= n0}

## Big O Notation : Upper Bound

`
O(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c and 
                  n0`
                  
`such that 0 <= f(n) <= c*g(n) for 
                  all n >= n0}

## Ω Notation : Lower Bound

`
Ω (g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c and
                  n0`

` such that 0 <= c*g(n) <= f(n) for
                  all n >= n0}.
